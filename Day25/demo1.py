# Enclosed scope:
# Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope
# Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions.
# The enclosing scope was added in Python 2.2. It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing functionâ€™s
# local scopes.
# Names that you define in the enclosing Python scope are commonly known as nonlocal names.
