# Array Module:

# import array
from array import array
# print(help(array))

# DESCRIPTION
#     This module defines an object type which can efficiently represent
#     an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point
#     numbers.  Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists,
#     except that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.
