# Functions()
# Function definition
# Calling the function

# There are two types of functions :
# 1).Pre-defined functions
# Examples : print(),sum(),max(),min().........

# 2).User Defined Functions

# What is function ?
# Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.
# The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function
# so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs,

# To define user function by using def keyword followed by function name():

# syntax
# def function():
# 	# body of function
# 	statement1
# 	statement2
# 	statement3
# 	.
# 	...


# How does it work?
print('before function definition - start here')
def function_name():
	print('Welcome to functions - inside')

print('Before calling the function')
function_name()
print('After the function call')

print(type(function_name))
# <class 'function'>

# before function definition - start here
# Before calling the function
# Welcome to functions - inside
# After the function call
