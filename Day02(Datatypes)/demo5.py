# Type conversion or casting

# In Python, we can convert one type of variable to another type.
# This conversion is called type casting or type conversion.
#
# In casting, we convert variables declared in specific data types to the different data types.
#
# Python performs the following two types of casting.
#
# 1. Implicit Type casting -Python avoids data loss by converting lower data types to higher data types.
#      For example, an integer 7, is converted to a float when added with another float, 2.2
#
# 2. Explicit casting: The explicit type conversion is performed by the user using built-in functions.
#
# int(): convert any type variable to the integer type.
# float(): convert any type variable to the float type.
# complex(): convert any type variable to the complex type.
# bool(): convert any type variable to the bool type.
# str(): convert any type variable to the string type.


# Int type conversion
# Casting float value to an integer
# Casting Boolean value to an integer
# Casting a string to an integer
#
# Float type conversion
# Casting integer to float
# Casting Boolean to float
# Casting string to float
#
# Complex type conversion
# Casting integer type to complex type
# Casting float type to complex type
# Casting Boolean type to complex type
#
# Bool type conversion - bool()
# Casting integer to Boolean type
# Casting float to Boolean type
# Casting string to Boolean type
# Casting complex type to Boolean type
#
# String type conversion
# Casting int to str type
# Casting float type to str type
# Casting complex type to str  type
# Casting bool type to str type

# Implicit(Inbuilt) type casting
a = 5.45 + 6
print(a)
# 11.45


b = bool(1)
print(b)
# True

b1 = bool(2)
print(b1)
# True

b3 = bool(0)
print(b3)
# False

n1 = bool(-45)
print(n1)
# True
