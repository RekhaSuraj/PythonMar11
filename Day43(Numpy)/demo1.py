# Numpy
# What is need numpy?
# By using python we can perform basic operations
# like : Addition, subtraction, multiplication ........

# To perform statistics solving the complex operations
# [Linear operation, Integration,Algebra, Trigonometry] , python doesn't  support that case we have to import
# Third-party libraries is numpy

# Data Science ,Machine Learning, deep learning  Extensisons  ---> Pandas, Matplot, numpy

# NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for working with arrays, numerical data,
# and mathematical operations efficiently.

# Features :
# Numpy is a super fast written in C.
# Supports multi-dimensional arrays (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.)
# It is the foundation of scientific computing in Python and is widely used in data science, machine learning, AI, image processing, and engineering.
# Pandas internally uses ndarray to store data, which is numpy data structure.
# It has vectorization feature which improves performance while iterating elements.
