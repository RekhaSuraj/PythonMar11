# Instance methods
# Calling Instance Variables by using Instance method
# Instance method: Used to access or modify the object state. If we use instance variables inside a method,
# such methods are called instance methods. It must have a self parameter to refer to the current object.

# self: The first argument self refers to the current object.
# It binds the instance to the __init__() method.
# Itâ€™s usually named self to follow the naming convention.
