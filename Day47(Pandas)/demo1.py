# Basic data structures in pandas
# Pandas provides two types of classes for handling data:
#
# Series: a one-dimensional labeled array holding data of any type
# such as integers, strings, Python objects etc.
#
# DataFrame: a two-dimensional data structure that holds data like a two-dimension array or a table with rows and
# columns.

l1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
s1 = pd.Series(data=l1,dtype='int32')
print(s1)

# 0    1
# 1    2
# 2    3
# 3    4
# 4    5
# 5    6
# dtype: int32
