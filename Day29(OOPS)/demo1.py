# OOPS --> Object orirented programming System

# Class, object[Methods and Attributes]
#        object[Behaviour and State]

# Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that almost all the code is implemented using a special construct called classes.
# A class is a code template for creating objects.
#
# What is a Class and Objects in Python?
#
# [Class: The class is a user-defined data structure that binds the data members and methods into a single unit.
# Class is a blueprint or code template for object creation. Using a class, you can create as many objects as you want.]
#
# Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a collection of attributes (variables) and methods. We use the object of a class to perform actions.
#
#
# Objects have two characteristics: They have states and behaviors (object has attributes and methods attached to it) Attributes represent its state,
# and methods represent its behavior. Using its methods, we can modify its state.
#
# In short, Every object has the following property.
#
# Identity: Every object must be uniquely identified.
# State: An object has an attribute that represents a state of an object, and it also reflects the property of an object.
# Behavior: An object has methods that represent its behavior.
#
# A real-life example of class and objects.
#
# Class: Person
#
# State: Name, Gender, Profession
#
# Behavior: Working, Study, Travel
#
# Using the above class, we can create multiple objects that depict different states and behavior.
#
# Object 1: Jessa
#
# State:
# Name: Jessa
# Gender: Female
# Profession: Software Engineer
#
# Behavior:
# Working: She is working as a software developer at ABC Company
# Study: She studies 2 hours a day
#
# Object 2:
#
# State:
# Name: Jon
# Sex: Male
# Profession: Doctor
#
# Behavior:
# Working: He is working as a doctor
# Study: He studies 5 hours a day
