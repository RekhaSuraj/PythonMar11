# Inheritance

# The process of inheriting(acquiring) the properties of the parent class into a child class is called inheritance.
# The existing class is called a base class or parent class or super class and the new class is called a subclass or child class or derived class.

# In Object-oriented programming, inheritance is an important aspect.
# The main purpose of inheritance is the reusability of code because we can use the existing class to create a new class instead of creating
#  it from scratch.

# In inheritance, the child class acquires all the data members, properties, and functions from the parent class. Also,
# a child class can also provide its specific implementation to the methods of the parent class.

# Types Of Inheritance
# In Python, based upon the number of child and parent classes involved, there are five types of inheritance.

# The type of inheritance are listed below:

# Single inheritance
# Multiple Inheritance
# Multilevel inheritance
# Hierarchical Inheritance
# Hybrid Inheritance
