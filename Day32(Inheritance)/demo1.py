# static methods:
# A @staticmethod is a method inside a class that:

# Does not need access to self (object).

# Does not need access to cls (class).

# It behaves like a normal function, but is put inside a class for organization.
# When to use @staticmethod:
# When the method doesnâ€™t depend on class or object data.
# When you want to group utility functions logically inside a class.

class Arithmetic_Tool:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x,y):
        return x+y

    @staticmethod
    def multiply(x,y):
        return x*y


v1 = Arithmetic_Tool.add(10,20)
print(v1)
# 30

v2 = Arithmetic_Tool.multiply(5,7)
# 35
print(v2)
