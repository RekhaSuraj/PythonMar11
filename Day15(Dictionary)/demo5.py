# Conditional statements
# In Python, condition statements act depending on whether a given condition is true or false.
# You can execute different blocks of codes depending on the outcome of a condition.
# Condition statements always evaluate to either True or False.
# There are Four types of conditional statements.
#
# if statement
# if-else
# if-elif-else
# nested if-else


# If statement in Python
# In control statements, The if statement is the simplest form.
# It takes a condition and evaluates to either True or False.
#
# If the condition is True, then the True block of code will be executed, and if the
# condition is False, then the block of code is skipped, and The controller moves to
# the next line

#
# Syntax of the if statement
#
# if condition:
#      statement 1
#      statement 2
#      statement n
#
# As mentioned before, the indented block starts after the : symbol, after the boolean expression.
# It will get executed when the condition is True. We have another block that should be executed when the
# if condition is False.
# First, complete the if block by a backspace and write else, put add the :
# symbol in front of the new block to begin it, and add the required statements in the block.


# x = True
# if x == True:
#     print("Condition is True")

# print('Outside of if condition')

# Condition is True
# Outside of if condition


y = False
if y == True:
    print('Condition is True')

print('Outside of if condition')
# # Outside of if condition
