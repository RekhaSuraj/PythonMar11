# Nested for loop
# nested for loop
# A for loop inside a for loop is called a nested for loop. The inner loop runs completely for each iteration of the outer loop.

# for i in range(outer_loop_range): # outer for loop
#     for j in range(inner_loop_range): #inner for loop
        # Code block to execute


for i in range(3):
	for j in range(3):
 		print('i','j',i,j)


# i j 0 0
# i j 0 1
# i j 0 2
# i j 1 0
# i j 1 1
# i j 1 2
# i j 2 0
# i j 2 1
# i j 2 2
